The very latest revision contains these features / improvements:

* Almost no overshoot (tunable PD control loop)
* Fan-test on startup
* Error message if wand is not connected or temperature is out of range
* Persistent temperature set-point storage
* Slow / fast temperature set-point change depending on button-press time
* Lower minimum temperature
* Option to blow cold air
* Shows live value of temperature (not just set-point)
* Set-point is shown if temperature is within +- 4°C (suppress +- 1°C noise on display)
* Indicate when temperature is safe to touch the heater

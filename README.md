================

CODE: Custom firmware for my Youyue 858D+ (ATmega168)

There is a 'user manual' of sorts in the 'Docs' folder.


Some videos showing the progress from 'stock firmware' with massive temperature overshoot
towards almost no overshoot at all.

Please note:

Although this device looks very much like ones sold by 'Atten' and others, the innards
are not necessarily the same. The heater / wand are probably the same, but I know that
e.g. the 'Atten 858D' uses a different mainboard with a different brand micro controller.

Naturally, this firmware will only work 'as is' for the exact mcu / mainboard combination I have.
Please see the 'Docs' folder for schematic and PCB photos.

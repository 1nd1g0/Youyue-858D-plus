Once the device (cold) is turned on, it will do the following:
==============================================================

* Start the fan for about 2 seconds and turn it off again
* Either display "---" if the temperature is below 40°C (safe to touch)
* Or display the current temperature if the temperature is above 40°C


Fan controls:
=============

* The fan-speed is set with the potentiometer
* If the wand is in the craddle and is cold (< 45°C), then fan is off
* If the wand is in the craddle and is too hot (> 60°C), the fan is on
* If the wand is out of the craddle, the fan is always on


Temperature control:
====================

* The base unit usually shows the current temperature (averaged)
* It shows the setpoint, if the temperature is within +- 3°C
* Temperature can be changed with the up/down buttons
* Short button press: +- 1°C
* Long button press:  +- 10°C
* The setpoint is stored in eeprom
* Temperature range: 50...500 °C (default: 75)


PID settings:
=============

* Config mode is entered by pressing both buttons _at the same time_
* When PID settings are changed, the heater is always off
* The state of the fan is not changed when entering config mode
* The display will show an abbreviated name for each parameter
* Going to the next one is done by pressing both buttons _at the same time_

  P) 	       p_gain    0...999 (default: 650)
  i)	       i_gain    0...999 (default:  15)
  d)  	       d_gain    0...999 (default: 750)
ith)      i_threshold    0...100 (default:  45)
tof) temp_offset_corr -100...100 (default:  33)

* All parameters stored / loaded from EEPROM are checked if within range
* Invalid parameters are reset to their minimum value when stored / loaded

i_threshold: temperature range (+-) that determines the switch between PD and PID
             if the temperature is far away from the setpoint, PD-control is used
	     if the temperature is within range, PID-control is used to stabilize

temp_offset_corr: can be used to correct a temperature difference between the display
                  and the temperature measured with an external sensor at the nozzle

		  increase, if you measure too high a temperature			
		  decrease, if measured temperature is too low


Restoring default values:
=========================

* Turn the device off
* Press both buttons at the same time
* The device will enter the PID settings menu with default value restored
* Either change the values again or turn the device off


Error behaviour:
================

* If the wand is disconnected or the thermo-couple has failed or the temperature
  is above MAX_TEMP_ERR (600°C), the device will go into a "safe mode".
  
  The heater will be turned off permanently, the fan will be turned on 
  to allow fast cooldown and the display will blink "FAN" until power is cycled.

Once the device (cold, wand in cradle) is turned on, it will do the following:
==============================================================================

* Display the firmware version
* Start the fan for about 2 seconds and turn it off again
* Either display "---" if the temperature is below 40°C (safe to touch)
* Or display the current temperature if the temperature is above 40°C


Fan controls:
=============

* The fan-speed is set with the potentiometer
* If the fan-speed is erratic, you need a new potentiometer
* If the wand is in the cradle and is cold (< 45°C), then fan is off
* If the wand is in the cradle and is too hot (> 60°C), the fan is on
* If the wand is out of the cradle, the fan is always on


Temperature control:
====================

* The base unit usually shows the current temperature (averaged)
* It shows the set-point, if the temperature is within +- 3°C
* Temperature can be changed with the up/down buttons
* Short button press: +- 1°C
* Long button press:  +- 10°C
* The set-point is stored in eeprom
* Temperature range: 50...500 °C


PID settings:
=============

* Config mode is entered by pressing both buttons _at the same time_
* When PID settings are changed, the heater is always off
* The state of the fan is not changed when entering config mode
* The display will show an abbreviated name for each parameter
* Going to the next one is done by pressing both buttons _at the same time_

  P)            p_gain    0...999
  i)            i_gain    0...999
  d)            d_gain    0...999
ith)       i_threshold    0...100
tof)  temp_offset_corr -100...100

* All parameters stored / loaded from EEPROM are checked if within range
* Invalid parameters are reset to their default values when stored / loaded
  (see youyue858d.h)

i_threshold: temperature range (+-) that determines the switch between PD and PID
             if the temperature is far away from the set-point, PD-control is used
             if the temperature is within range, PID-control is used to stabilize

temp_offset_corr: can be used to correct a temperature difference between the display
                  and the temperature measured with an external sensor at the nozzle

                  increase, if you measure too high a temperature			
                  decrease, if measured temperature is too low


Restoring default:
==================

* Turn the device off
* Press and hold both buttons at the same time
* Turn the device on and wait a couple of seconds
* The device will enter the PID settings menu with default value restored
* Either change the values again or turn the device off


Sleep timeout:
==============

SLP)     slp_timeout  0...30 (default: 5)

If the wand is not placed into the cradle for longer than slp_timeout, the heater
is switched off, but the fan keeps running indefinitely.


Error behaviour:
================

* If the wand is disconnected or the thermo-couple has failed or the temperature
  is above MAX_TEMP_ERR (550°C), the device will go into a "safe mode".
  
  The heater will be turned off permanently, the fan will be turned on 
  to allow fast cool-down and the display will blink "FAN" until power is cycled.

* If the device is powered up and the wand is not in the cradle, an error message
  will be displayed. Put the wand into the cradle and cycle power for normal
  operation.

  This should avoid any issues with the device being accidentally powered on 
  with the wand on the table (e.g. after power outage).

* If the fan-speed on power-up (fan-test) is out of range (F-L, F-h config parameters),
  an error message "FAN" will be displayed.

  (This does not necessarily detect a stalled fan, as the feedback is just the
   drive voltage, not an actual tacho signal!)

* If the WATCHDOG is used (by default) and the device becomes unresponsive for more
  than about 120ms AND the heater is ON, a watchdog-reset is triggered.

  THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN.

  The device will turn off the heater and turn on the fan. The display will blink
  the error code "rSt" until power is cycled.
